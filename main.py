'''The International Foundation for the Preservation of our Water Supplies (IFPWS), a non-profit, non-governmental organisation, has asked you to develope a game that educates people about the risk of global warming; specifically, the extreme water level changes that will occur if global warming is allowed to continue. As this game is for 13 - 16 year olds, it is to be suitably exaggerated to show these water fluctuations. /n This game is to be created in Python 3.3, and is to show extreme rain and extreme drought. The IFPWS asks for this game to be submtted to their tester, Ms Katherine Young, in 3 weeks time, on Thursday.
