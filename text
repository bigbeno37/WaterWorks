CLANG!
A steel pipe hit the ground in front of you, waking yourself up.
As you open your eyes, they come to realise that you are in a mildly lit cave
You get upon your feet, and walk over to the pipe, laid down on the damp rock grond
You see an exit to this cave, but also a hole in the wall
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
You pick up the iron pipe, and hit it against the mouldy wall
The pipe gets lodged in the hole, and even with all your strength put into it, you cannot get it out
You therefore decide to try to follow the exit out
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
As you approach the exit, a sudden feeling of dread and despair fills your gut
You swear you hear a ghastly scream emerge from the exit
After you gather up your courage, you walk past it, only to find the path split into two
