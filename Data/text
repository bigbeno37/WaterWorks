CLANG!
A steel pipe hit the ground in front of you, waking yourself up.
As you open your eyes, they come to realise that you are in a mildly lit cave
You get upon your feet, and walk over to the pipe, laid down on the damp rock grond
You see an exit to this cave, but also a hole in the wall
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
You pick up the iron pipe, and hit it against the mouldy wall
The pipe gets lodged in the hole, and even with all your strength put into it, you cannot get it out
You therefore decide to try to follow the exit out
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// ABLE TO GO UP OR DOWN
As you approach the exit, a sudden feeling of dread and despair fills your gut
You swear you hear a ghastly scream emerge from the exit
After you gather up your courage, you walk past it, only to find the path split into two
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// END 1 (WENT DOWN)
You decide that, while you're here, you may as well go down
As you descend into the apparent abyss below, you hear a mechanical movement
You feel yourself begin to wobble, and all sources of light have gone out
It is pitch black, and all of a sudden you feel yourself falling rapidly...
SPLAT!
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Even though going down looks tempting, you decide to go up
After what seems like a true milennia, you arrive at a door
As it slowly creaks open, you happen to see what's inside
On both sides of the room lay a door, both having a sign above them
On inspection of the dull grey room, the signs appear to say:
UPI ZIDY HP OMYP YJR ARGY FPPT
Confused, you have to choose which door to go into
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// END 2 (WENT THROUGH RIGHT DOOR)
You turn to the right door, confused about these sequence of events
As you touch the doorknob, a blinding white light shines through the cracks in the door
It touches your skin...
You drop dead
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
You go towards the left door, and slowly twist the knob
With an audible moan, the door opens, though it takes some effort to do so
As you enter, you see daylight
You close the door, and look around
Metallic pipes litter the skyline and in the distance you can hear thunder
Before long, you start feeling the ground underneath you shake
Frantically, you look around
You see an abandoned shed and an abandoned house
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// END 3 (WENT TO HOUSE)
As the earth trembles, you quickly open the door to the house, and jump inside
It is pitch black
All of a sudden, you feel a warm sensation in your stomach
You touch it, and feel blood
You've been stabbed
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
You desperately run to the broken down shed
You slam the door open and run inside
The room is well lit from the sun outside
On a bench in front of you is a lever
Right next to it is a warning:
ADVERTENCIA: Esto activar√° la secuencia de-
The rest has been torn off
There is also a button on the wall, without any labelling
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
You go outside, only to see pipes dropping like flies from the sky
You need to find cover, but where?
In a matter of seconds, the shed is obliterated into splinters of wood
You look around
There is a rusty gate in the distance that leads to the outside world
There is also a metal door that leads into a tall building
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// END 4 (WENT INTO BUILDING)
After swiftly dodging a wave of falling pipes, you enter the building
Upon entering, you notice the subtle flickering of a light bulb ahead
You walk towards it, and hear a loud PHWOOOSH
A pipe has exploded in the room
You bolt back to the metal door, but even with all your stength, you cannot open it back up
The room fills with water
Blub blub blub....
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
You sprint to the gate and with great speed exit the area
With a final loud BANG, all the pipes fall to the ground
BOOOM
A thunderstorm is growing closer
You see a forest nearby; perhaps that will contain some shelter
You also see a vast plains area
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// END 5 (GOTO PLAINS)
As you make your decision, you feel rain pouring on your body
You start running, frantically looking for any cover that you can
You also notice the sun going down
.
..
...
It is not long before it is night, and the night is shattered with the sound of rain
You have no warm clothing and are extremely cold
Brrr...
brr...
...
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
It is not long before the dreaded storm catches up with you, bringing it's fierce wind and weather with it
The air almost seems to howl with the incomprehensible speed of the air moving inbetween the trees surrounding you
You feel scared, and the world seems to just be eerily watching you move
You begin to sprint when all of a sudden you fall over
Dazed, you look around, and see a hidden mountain cover next to you
You hurridly go into it, and begin to doze off


You are awoken by the sharp sounds of what appears to be a helicopter in the sky
Excitedly, you get up, and scream HERE HERE!
The helicopter goes on ahead, seemingly leaving you behind
You decide that you should either follow the helicopter as fast as you can, or try to find food and water
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// BAD ENDING
You decide that you're better off trying to survive than to try to catch up to the helicopter
You wander off in the broad daylight, and begin your search of water and food


Your throat is parched and your mouth is dry, but yet you carry on walking
You see a bucket in the distance ahead, and decide to pick it up
Quite near the bucket is a house
Desperately searching for something to drink, you enter the house
Upon entering, you place the bucket down, and notice that the roof seems to be rather weak
Weak enough to let water start dripping through
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// GOOD ENDING
Utilising the last of your strength, you push forward beyond your immediate surroundings
You can still hear the helicopter in the distance; but where...
Will a solid will, you continue, irregardless of how desperate this whole ordeal seems
The sound of the whirring blades continues to grow louder with each step you take
You traverse a hill when suddenly
in the distanceTrue
You see the helicopter
With extreme pleasure, you scream HELP!
The helicopter crew come to you, as you proceed to faint with fatigue
Your last memory of that day is being slowly lifted into the helicopter, the mechanisms inside gently stirring you into unconciousness
